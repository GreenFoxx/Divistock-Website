                        <h2 class="section-heading text-center">How does Divistock work?</h2>
                        <p class="large text-muted">What this currency will do is create a blockchain where companies that have distributed shares on the share markets around the world shall be able to easily create a token that can tether the value of their stockâ€™s price. For example if Company A has a share that is selling for $5.00 each on the NYSE they would be able to easily create a token on our blockchain that would tether the price at $5.00 per token. If the share price went down to $4.50 the price of their token on our blockchain would reflect this as well at $4.50 and so on.</p>

                        <h4 class="service-heading">Solution</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted text-left"></p><p class="text-no-margin text-left text-muted">So what will this solve? This will allow for companies that want to be able to enter their company into the crypto world to do so with ease with a token that directly reflects their companies value. It would allow for people to buy and sell their tokens for the exact same prices as their companies shares making it so that people can hold many more companies value without having to buy stocks, go through the share market, own any equity in the company and buy the token as easy as it is to buy any other token in the crypto world.

                        <h4 class="service-heading">Concept</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted text-left">The concept of this currency is that it is a solution to the gap between shares and cryptocurrencies. Companies around the world are creating their own tokens, coins and even some just changing their name to accommodate the crypto world to drive up their share price with overwhelming success. But not all these companies have the time, knowledge or resources to create their own token as a reflection of their companies value. And for what purpose would this be useful to them if not by just gaining money from ICOs and selling their stockpiled coins/tokens on the open market after the price has been driven up?

                        <p class="text-muted text-left">Companies that make tokens with our blockchain shall be able to hold their own ICO to gain funds from investors. They must do this in a way that is compliant with the SEC and Divistock will be fully compliant with the SEC. Any if any company does something that is non-compliant with the SEC, Divistock shall not be liable. This will be agreed upon by the company before they create a token on our blockchain. companies will also be able to charge a fee for all transactions on their token.
